# Lyractle

## Short description
This is a game based on the Redactle game. The goal is to to determine the title of a song from either a random artist or a chosen artist.


### Instructions
You will be presented with 30% of the lyrics of a song. Your goal is to find the title of the song in as few guesses as possible! Some words are visible, while others are hidden. Each guess you make, where the word appears in the song lyrics, will unveil the hidden words. If your guess does not appear in the song lyrics, nothing will be reveiled, but your guess count will increase. Input is not case sensitive.

When you are testing and can't figure out the answer, you can cheat by opening the console and typing:
myModel.currentTrack.track.track_name
(but this is cheating ðŸ˜‰)
